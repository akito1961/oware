# A Study of the Exploration of Strategies in Oware Game with Alpha-Beta Pruning Minimax Algorithm

## Abstract
Artificial intelligence has managed to show that algorithms with adversarial search can solve complex games like Chess and Go. Oware is a two-player board game from Africa with a unique playstyle. The objective of the game is to capture more seeds than the opponent by sowing. The aim of this research is to study the alpha-beta pruning minimax algorithm for solving the game with strategies adapted from solving other variations of the Mancala family, finding sets of weighted strategies with the genetic algorithm, and evaluating the performance.
